# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
This project was done for Alphabet Soup, a company who funds other organizations. The company is hoping to improve the effect of their funding by determining which organizations have used the funding well.
The project involves machine learning and neural networks to analyze historical data from the company with a goal of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### Background
Alphabet Soup has historical data from the companies they've funded. The company provided information the form of a CSV that contains informtation about previously funded companies who are asking for additional funding. 

## Results
Use bulleted lists and images
o	There is a bulleted list that answers all six questions (15 pt)
### Data Preprocessing
* Target variables
    * Nested bullet
    * Nested bullet

* Features variables
    * Nested bullet
    * Nested bullet

* Other variables
    * Nested bullet
    * Nested bullet

o	Data Preprocessing
	What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
	What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
	What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
o	Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
	How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
	Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
	What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* Number of adjusted items
    * Neurons
    * Layers
    * Activation functions

Results
	Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
Optimizing steps
	What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
